		<theme name="Helios">
			<description>
				<html:p>This is the EclipseLink release that will go into the annual
					Eclipse release named Helios scheduled for release on June 23rd
					2010. Some work will be required to ensure all of the release
					train
					requirements are met and that EclipseLink functions well within the
					IDE as well as within the RT platform. This work will include
					addressing better OSGi/Equinox compatibility.
				</html:p>

		<theme name="Community">
			<description>
				<html:p>The last couple of release cycles have had a focus on major
					new feature areas (SDO, DBWS, JPA 2.0). This work has prevented the
					project team from keeping up with the community's request for
					enhancements and bug fixes. This release will endeavor to reduce
					the bug backlog to a more reasonable quantity.

					Continued improvements to usability focusing on simplified
					getting started steps as
					well as ability to find technical
					information on how EclipseLink works and how to solve both common
					and advanced requirements. 
				</html:p>
			</description>
		</theme>

		<theme name="Documentation">
			<description>
				<html:p>The EclipseLink 2.1 release will include a new set of
					documentation delivered in HTML and PDF formats. This effort is
					based on these requirements. The goal is to improve the usability
					of the
					documentation.  
				</html:p>
			</description>
		</theme>

		<theme name="Advanced">
			<description>
				<html:p>In this release the project is planning to increase the
					advanced features available through standard API using common
					extension points, custom annotations, and extended XML
					configuration
					files. The goal is to enable users to work with the
					standards (JPA, JAXB, SDO) as much as possible and simplify the
					usage of advanced features.
