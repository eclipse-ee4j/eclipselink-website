<body>
The Eclipse Persistence Services Project (EclipseLink) incubator
project's goal is to provide an extensible framework that will enable
Java developers to interact with relational databases, XML, and
Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) in an efficient and productive
manor. EclipseLink will focus on supporting leading persistence
standards including the Java Persistence API (JPA), Java API for XML
Binding (JAXB), Java Connector Architecture (JCA), and Service Data
Objects (SDO).
