			<h1>EclipseLink EIS</h1>
			<p>
			The EclipseLink EIS provides support for developing Java
			applications where non-relational data stores must be
			integrated. EclipseLink allows developers to map between
			their domain model and the records or XML interchanged with
			the underlying data store using JCA resource adapters.
